# `// PTAL This should be automated`

This is a small script to post comments from code (specifically, code _diffs_),
as pull request comments.

This kind of thing can be helpful to draw reviewers'
attention, and generally speaking, to make specific code changes, opinions, problems,
or questions more public than Github GUI's interface currently encourages.

This began as a gist,
[here](https://gist.github.com/whilei/54758c05e7355130ce95127645415efa).

### Install

> Change me.
```shell
# (This assumes that $HOME/bin is already in your $PATH.)
$ curl -o $HOME/bin/ptal https://gist.github.com/whilei/54758c05e7355130ce95127645415efa/raw/7d90c9f802e2191b773becb9a7f0c8de24a6cf08/ptal && chmod +x $HOME/bin/ptal
```
